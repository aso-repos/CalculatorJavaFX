Paste the entire thing into your README.md file in GitHub or IntelliJ.

You don’t need to manually add any triple backticks (```), and you don’t need to add or remove any formatting. GitHub will automatically format everything like headers, emoji, and code blocks when it renders the markdown.

Let me know when it’s up on your repo or if you’d like help adjusting it after reviewing the live result.






You said:
Everything looks good. Just those parts that were outside the grey code block, seems to be unformatted and the links not ctive


ChatGPT said:
Perfect — you’re absolutely right, and I can confirm:
The issue with some parts (like “Related Projects,” “Contact,” “Learning Context,” etc.) appearing unformatted or with broken links is likely because:

When copying the README from here into GitHub, only part of the markdown syntax (like headers and links) was interpreted properly

Some text outside the gray code block may have been incompletely selected or misrendered when pasted

✅ How to Fix It Quickly:
Go to your repository on GitHub

Open the README.md file and click ✏️ Edit

Replace the entire contents with the latest full version (below)

Click “Preview” to make sure the formatting looks right

Then scroll down and click “Commit changes”

# 🧮 CalculatorJavaFX

A clean, minimal desktop calculator built using Java and JavaFX.  
This project combines my existing Java knowledge with new JavaFX skills to create a real-world application while building confidence in UI development, Git workflows, and desktop app structure.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**CalculatorJavaFX** is a hands-on JavaFX application created as a learning milestone to transition from structured Java coursework into applied desktop development.

This project:
- Applies core object-oriented Java principles
- Builds a custom-styled calculator UI using JavaFX
- Reinforces GitHub-based version control and portfolio building
- Bridges the gap between academic training and production-style apps

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Interactive number buttons (0–9)
- Arithmetic operations: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
- Clear and backspace functionality
- Fixed-size, non-resizable window (340x500)
- Custom window icon (`aso_logo.png`)
- Grey background and centered display area (placeholder for now)
- (Planned) keyboard support and button hover styling

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Java 21 (Azul ZuluFX JDK)
- JavaFX 21 (from GluonHQ)
- IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1 (Community Edition)
- Git & GitHub (fully integrated)
- (Future) Scene Builder for visual layout (FXML)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aso-repos/CalculatorJavaFX.git
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA

Configure JavaFX SDK in your VM options (if not already set):

cpp
Copy
Edit
--module-path "C:\Java\javafx-sdk-21\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
Run the Main.java file
You should see a grey calculator window with your custom logo in the title bar.

📸 Screenshots
Coming soon — layout under construction.

🎓 Learning Context
This project accompanies my JavaFX learning through:

Bro Code’s JavaFX Course on YouTube

Practical experiments mirrored in a separate repo: BroCourse

It reflects the transition from academic Java training into independently built applications — applying lessons from a full Java Specialization completed through Duke University & UC San Diego.
