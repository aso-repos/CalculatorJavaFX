# 🧮 CalculatorJavaFX

A clean, minimal desktop calculator built using Java and JavaFX.  
This project combines my existing Java knowledge with new JavaFX skills to create a real-world application while building confidence in UI development, Git workflows, and desktop app structure.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**CalculatorJavaFX** is a hands-on JavaFX application created as a learning milestone to transition from structured Java coursework into applied desktop development.

This project:
- Applies core object-oriented Java principles
- Builds a custom-styled calculator UI using JavaFX
- Reinforces GitHub-based version control and portfolio building
- Bridges the gap between academic training and production-style apps

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Interactive number buttons (0–9)
- Arithmetic operations: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
- Clear and backspace functionality
- Fixed-size, non-resizable window (340x500)
- Custom window icon (`aso_logo.png`)
- Grey background and centered display area (placeholder for now)
- (Planned) keyboard support and button hover styling

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Java 21 (Azul ZuluFX JDK)
- JavaFX 21 (from GluonHQ)
- IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1 (Community Edition)
- Git & GitHub (fully integrated)
- (Future) Scene Builder for visual layout (FXML)

## 🚀 How to Run

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aso-repos/CalculatorJavaFX.git
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA

Configure JavaFX SDK in your VM options (if not already set):

cpp
Copy
Edit
--module-path "C:\Java\javafx-sdk-21\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
Run the Main.java file
You should see a grey calculator window with your custom logo in the title bar.

🎓 Learning Context
This project accompanies my JavaFX learning through:

Bro Code’s JavaFX Course on YouTube

Practical experiments mirrored in a separate repo: BroCourse

It reflects the transition from academic Java training into independently built applications — applying lessons from a full Java Specialization completed through Duke University & UC San Diego.
