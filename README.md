# 🧮 CalculatorJavaFX

A clean, retro-style desktop calculator built using **Java** and **JavaFX**, inspired by the **Casio Personal M-1** calculator. This project bridges the gap between structured Java coursework and real-world GUI development — applying design, coding, and problem-solving skills into a fully functional, visually polished app.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**CalculatorJavaFX** is a milestone JavaFX application created to:
- Transition from academic Java training into desktop GUI development
- Reinforce object-oriented principles and modular JavaFX design
- Develop practical GitHub workflow and open-source portfolio experience
- Showcase a retro calculator with precise UI, custom font, and LED-style glow effects

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

✅ Custom-designed **CalculatorDigits.ttf** font  
✅ Decimal point manually spaced and aligned using FontForge  
✅ LED-style **display glow effect** with duplicate label + drop shadow  
✅ Accurate retro calculator layout using Scene Builder  
✅ Clean window with fixed dimensions and custom icon  
✅ GitHub-tracked learning and version control throughout

---

## 📐 Design Inspiration

- Based on the **Casio Personal M-1** calculator — a personal keepsake
- All digits (0–9 and dot) were redrawn in CorelDRAW and converted to vector
- Final font manually kerned and spaced in FontForge for 1:1 alignment
- Display layered with StackPane for foreground + glow labels
- LED glow achieved using subtle Gaussian `dropshadow` in CSS

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Java 21 (Azul ZuluFX JDK)
- JavaFX 21 (via GluonHQ SDK)
- IntelliJ IDEA CE 2024.1
- Scene Builder (for layout construction)
- CorelDRAW + FontForge (custom font design)
- Git & GitHub (version control and portfolio publishing)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aso-repos/CalculatorJavaFX.git
Open in IntelliJ IDEA

Configure JavaFX VM options:

cpp
Copy
Edit
--module-path "C:/Java/javafx-sdk-21/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
Run Main.java

Calculator should appear with LED-style display and turquoise digit glow
